# Roboverse - Web front-end for the Gazebo simulator

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4a074acdbb72411cb330420b93333254)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/HabitatZero/roboverse/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=HabitatZero/roboverse&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) [![DeepSource](https://deepsource.io/gh/HabitatZero/roboverse.svg/?label=active+issues&show_trend=true)](https://deepsource.io/gh/HabitatZero/roboverse/?ref=repository-badge)

Roboverse is a project meant to help with both the developer and user experience of robotics tooling. At present, the robotics ecosystem primarily uses C/C++ and Python, with Linux as the host system. You _can_ develop using other OSes and frameworks, but it's a pain. This is meant to lessen that pain, by moving the simulation software to the browser to make that OS independent and easy to get started with.

In short, it is a fork and ongoing rewrite in Rust and Svelte of [osrf/gzweb](https://github.com/osrf/gzweb)

Like gzweb, it is also a WebGL client for [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org).and like gzclient, it's a front-end graphical interface to gzserver and provides visualization of the simulation.

## Installation

For now, you can use the gzweb instructions:
See the tutorial [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=gzweb_install&cat=gzweb)

## Development

For now, you can use the gzweb instructions:
